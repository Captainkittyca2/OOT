## version 0.7:
  Adjustments:
    * Meter now can go below zero and into negative numbers. Because of this, most of the items can be used as long as meter isn't below zero.
  New:
    * Dropped bombs. bombchus, arrow levels 1, 2, and 3, and Deku seeds, nuts, and sticks are converted to meter jars.
    * Before unlocking first meter upgrade, you'll have a custom meter which is half the amount of the first meter.

## version 0.6:
  New:
    * Lens of truth consumes the meter faster.
    * The preview consumption color has been changed from yellow to green.
    * The game mode now supports custom meter colors from the cosmetic editor.
  Bug-fixes:
    * After loading your file, the meter will be adjusted appropriately when you enable/disable the game mode.
    * If you haven't unlocked the meter yet and have the game mode enabled, try disabling and enabling and should then unlock it.
    * If you load your file and the ammo in the meter exceeds the bar itself, enable/disable the game mode and it should be fixed.
